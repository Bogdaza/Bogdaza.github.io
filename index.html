  <h1>The the introduction.</h1>
    <center><p>As we know there are plenty of abandoned buildings in
      <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerevan" target="_blank">Yerevan</a></em>
      , so I made a list of <strong>must-seen</strong> of them. Also <strong>whole this ranking</strong>
      is just author's own notions and impressions.</p></center>
  <br><h2>The 1st place:</h2>
    <div class="flex-container"><div class="img"><img src="hall.jpg" alt="bright hall"></div>
    <div class="img"><img src="octaider.jpg" alt="8"></div>
    <ul>
      <li>The first thing that you should know is that this place is huge enough to spend there <b>over 2 hours.</b></li>
      <li>As I understood, this building was made as a <em>clock factory</em> and then abandoned,but not completely.</li>
      <li><em><strong>The first floor is still used for production of something.</strong></em></li>
      <li>Therefore you should be careful that you will not be <b>captured</b> and it is better to do not make any loud noises,<em> such as kicking a door.</em></li>
      <li> In addition, there will be beautiful view to the city, <em>especially during the sunset.</em></li>
    </ul></div>
  <p>Now I will show you <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D0%A7%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9+%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4,+13+Sose+St,+Yerevan+0019/@40.1950682,44.5035656,19.25z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x406abd1658989449:0x31a0e2057541f2a4!8m2!3d40.1950479!4d44.5032445!16s%2Fg%2F11c1byr3d3?entry=ttu" target="_blank">
    the address</a> and a few other images:</p><br>
  <div class="container"><div class="img"><img src="wtf.jpg" alt="what the hell is happening?" class="image"></div>
  <div class="cnt"><div id="conclusion">Honestly, I strongly recommend this place for visiting!</div>
  <div class="img"><img src="outsideview.jpg" alt="writing on the wall" class="image"></div></div></div>
  <h3><strong>The second place:</strong></h3>
  <div class="cont">
    <div class="img"><img src="1.jpg" alt="photo"></div>
    <div id="text">This place <em>I have not visited yet</em>, but some of my friends were there.<br>
      <strong>According to their impressions</strong>: it is not big building, but there are some interesting objects.<br>
      For instance: there is <strong>ferry framework</strong> and <strong>ship's helm</strong> on the second floor.<br>
      On the other hand, this <em><strong>construction is a part of another building</strong></em>, which is nowadays a hotel.<br>
      Hence you should be careful and attentive not to get caught. Also do not be fishy, while you are passing the hotel.</div>
