  <h1>The introduction.</h1>
    <center><p>As we know there are plenty of abandoned buildings in
      <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerevan" target="_blank">Yerevan</a></em>
      , so I made a list <strong>must-seen</strong> of the onesthat are worth a visit. Also <strong>this whole ranking</strong>
      is just author's own notions and impressions.</p></center>
  <br><h2>The 1st place:</h2>
    <div class="flex-container"><div class="img"><img src="hall.jpg" alt="bright hall"></div>
    <div class="img"><img src="octaider.jpg" alt="8"></div>
    <ul>
      <li>The first thing that you should know is that this place is huge enough to spend <b>mare than 2 hours there.</b></li>
      <li>As I understood, this building was made as a <em>clock factory</em> and then abandoned,but not completely.</li>
      <li><em><strong>The first floor is still being used for production of something.</strong></em></li>
      <li>Therefore you should be careful to avoid being <b>caught</b> and it is better to do not make any loud noises,<em> such as kicking a door.</em></li>
      <li> In addition, you will be able to get a beautiful city view, <em>especially during the sunset.</em></li>
    </ul></div>
  <p>Now I will show you <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D0%A7%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9+%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4,+13+Sose+St,+Yerevan+0019/@40.1950682,44.5035656,19.25z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x406abd1658989449:0x31a0e2057541f2a4!8m2!3d40.1950479!4d44.5032445!16s%2Fg%2F11c1byr3d3?entry=ttu" target="_blank">

  <h3><strong>The 2nd place:</strong></h3>
  <div class="cont">
    <div class="img"><img src="1.jpg" alt="photo"></div>
    <div id="text">This place <em>I have not visited yet</em>, but some of my friends have already been there.<br>
      <strong>According to their impressions</strong>: it is not a big building, but there are some interesting objects.<br>
      For instance: there is <strong>a ferry framework</strong> and <strong>a ship's helm</strong> on the second floor.<br>
      On the other hand, this <em><strong>construction is a part of another building</strong></em>, which is nowadays a hotel.<br>
      Hence you should be careful and attentive not to get caught. Also do not be fishy, while you are passing the hotel.</div>
    <div class="img"><img src="2.jpg" alt="photo"></div>
  </div><br>
  <div class="c">
    <ul>
      <li>To sum up: you should visit this place, just to see Yerevan lake.</li>
      <li>This construction is not huge, but it has a few interesting items.</li>
      <li>Also there is a modern, good organised embankment.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>These are <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/40%C2%B009'42.4%22N+44%C2%B028'29.0%22E/@40.1617778,44.4747222,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d40.1617778!4d44.4747222?entry=ttu" target="_blank">the coordinates</a> of the jetty on the opposite side of the lake.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>This construction may not be so interesting as the previous two, but it has its own secrets.</li>
      <li>Also it may be funny to visit it with your friends.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>For instance: there are old prices on different goods in supermarket on all walls.</li>
